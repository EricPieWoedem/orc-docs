##  Caution

**Dear User,**

After successfully registering an entity in the system, the user whose credentials (e.g., Ghana Card) were used during the registration process will receive a verification email. Kindly ensure that this email is verified promptly.

Once verification is complete, the status will change from "Pending Verification" to "Pending Approval." At this stage, an assigned officer will review the submitted information to ensure its accuracy and completeness. Only after this review and confirmation will the registration be approved.

**Thank you for using the system.**
